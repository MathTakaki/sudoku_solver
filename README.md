# Sudoku Solver

This project implements a **Sudoku Solver** in Python. It uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a 9x9 Sudoku grid. The solver takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and outputs the solved grid, or indicates if the puzzle is unsolvable.

## Features
- Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.
- Backtracking algorithm ensures all solutions are found efficiently.
- Includes input validation to handle invalid Sudoku boards.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
